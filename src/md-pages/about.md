Hi! Salut! How far? Nda? Kedu?

My name is Chibuzo Chiwike, and I'm a '22 at Dartmouth College. I'm majoring in Computer Science and maybe minoring in French, and in my free time I like to read or listen to books, consume copious amounts of soy milk, pretend to write code, and sing off-tune. I grew up in Aba, Nigeria, and went to Dority International Secondary School. At sixteen, I dragged too many suitcases across the ocean to begin a new chapter of my life at Dartmouth, leaving behind my home and the keys to those very suitcases (true story. I had to break into my own suitcases). I took intro to CS, and decided that since I wasn't the worst at it, it would become my source of revenue. So, here I am.

I speak 2.5 languagesâ€•English, Igbo, and French. The .5 is French, even though I've been learning it for more than 12 years. In January, I hopped on a plane with two suitcases (I learned!) to Lyon to finally become fluent in the darned thing, and arrived in Lyon with zero suitcases, thanks to missing my connection flight. If you can't tell, I'm still not fluent, although I did get my bags back. On gagne certaines choses et perd les autres, non?

I like writing stories. I hope one day to finish one of them. If I do, I'll let you know.

Any hoo, all the techy stuff is on my resume, if you're looking to hire. Don't be a stranger, say hi on Linkedin or fill out the contact form.

Till next time,\
Chibuzo.
